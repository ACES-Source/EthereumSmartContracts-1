Visibility Types


# internal / external / public / private

internal: only the contract and it's inheritors can call this function
 
external: only external contracts can call this function
 
public: anyone can call this function
 
private: only this contract can call this function


# Error handling

require: make sure the condition is met before executing the rest of the function

*this will return the remaining gas to the contract caller*

assert: this is similar to require but should only be used for emergencies

* this will burn the remaining gas*
