Ethereum Events

Events allow the use of EVM to log certain events which can be monitored by javascript event listeners on a front-end application

Block headers must be supplied because the contract can only see up to 256 blocks back

indexed(param1, param2, param3): up to 3 parameters can be passed to indexed for minitoring / logging

string and bytes are stored as hashes rather than the actual string or byte value

if you use the annonymous specifier then you won't be able to filter by name only by hash
